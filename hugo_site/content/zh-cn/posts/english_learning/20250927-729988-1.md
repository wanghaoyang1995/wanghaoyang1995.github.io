> <strong style="color: red">Inane</strong> <strong style="color: orange">short-form videos</strong> just stimulating enough to keep you watching and scrolling, in a zombie-like manner, through whatever the algorithm presents next; not quite dull enough for you to <strong style="color: orange">tear</strong> your <strong style="color: red">monetisable</strong> eyeballs away from the screen.  
> 空洞却又足够刺激的短视频通过用算法不断展示下一条内容，让你像行尸走肉一样观看和下滑；它也不算太无聊以至于会让你那双能变现的眼球从屏幕上移开。
>
> Economists may soon start to think of brainrot as a means of theft.  
> 经济学家们可能不久就会开始考虑将脑腐视为一种盗窃手段。
>
> Increasingly, the discipline is modelling attention as a resource, <strong style="color: red">alongside</strong> land, labour and <strong style="color: orange">capital</strong>.  
> 该学科（经济学）越来越多地将注意力建模为一种与土地、劳动力和资本并列的资源。
>
> Attention is <strong style="color: red">scarce</strong> and <strong style="color: red">rivalrous</strong> in the field's <strong style="color: red">jargon</strong>; time spent on brainrot cannot be spent on something else.  
> 在该领域（经济学领域）术语中，注意力是稀缺的、有竞争性的；花在脑腐上的时间就不能用于其它事物。
