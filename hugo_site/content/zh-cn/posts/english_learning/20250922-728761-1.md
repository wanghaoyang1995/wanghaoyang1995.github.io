> ### How Many Steps Do You Really Need in a Day?
> 
> Walking 10,000 steps a day has long been a fitness <strong style="color: red">cliche</strong>.  
> 每天走1万步已经成为老生常谈的健身法则。
>
> But new research suggests that the health benefits of walking <strong style="color: red">ramp up</strong> until about 7,000 steps - before <strong style="color: red">leveling out</strong>.  
> 但是最新研究表明，步行的健康益处持续增加直到大约7000步达到峰值。
>
> And as daily goals go, that's a little more <strong style="color: red">attainable</strong>.  
> 就日常目标而言，这是一个稍微更容易达到的目标。
>
> The analysis, published today in the medical journal The Lancet Public Health, examined data from 57 studies and found that even moderate amounts of walking were associated with a lower risk of <strong style="color: red">dementia</strong> and <strong style="color: red">cardiovascular</strong> disease, among other conditions, adding to <strong style="color: orange">a wide body of</strong> research tying walking to longevity.  
> 如今发表在医学期刊《柳叶刀》上的一项研究，分析了57个研究数据，发现即使中等数量的行走步数也与老年痴呆、心血管疾病等其它健康风险的降低相关，这一研究充实了大量将步行与长寿联系起来的研究证据。
>
> While most scientific reviews have looked at how higher step counts are linked to lower risk of cardiovascular disease and death, the new analysis examined associations across a much broader range of conditions.  
> 大多数科学综述关注的是更多的步数与更低的心血管疾病和死亡率的关联，而这项新的分析研究了步数与更广泛健康问题的关联。
>
> For example, the study found that walking 7,000 steps a day was associated with a lower risk of Type 2 <strong style="color: red">diabetes</strong>, <strong style="color: orange">depressive symptoms</strong> and cancer death, when compared with 2,000 steps.  
> 例如，研究发现，与每天2000步相比，每天步行7000步与更低的2型糖尿病风险、减少抑郁症状、除低癌症死亡风险相关。

**... among other conditions, ...**

**While most scientific reviews have looked at how higher step counts are linked to lower risk of cardiovascular disease and death, the new analysis examined associations across a much broader range of conditions.**

这两句不好理解，重点在于`condition`，在医疗语境下，可翻译为“疾病/健康状况”。

`depressive symptoms`含义为“抑郁症状”，不是指临床诊断的“抑郁症”（`depression`）
