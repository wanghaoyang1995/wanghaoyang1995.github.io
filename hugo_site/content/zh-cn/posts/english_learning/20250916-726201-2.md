> Now things are changing. For the first time in 15 years, <strong style="color: red">barring</strong> <strong style="color: red">blips</strong> in 2012 and 2018, wage growth for "job-stayers", those who have <strong style="color:red">stuck with</strong> their employer, is running fast than for "job-switchers", those who jumped ship, according to data from the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta.  
> 现在情况正在发生变化。根据亚特兰大联邦储备银行的数据，除了2012和2018年的微小波动以外，那些坚持与雇主在一起的“留任者”的薪资增长，在15年里首次出现了快于那些跳船的“跳槽者”的情况。
